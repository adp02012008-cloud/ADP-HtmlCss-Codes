    <p> HTML, or &nbsp; HyperText Markup Language, serves as the <mark>language</mark>  for <s>hello</s>structuring content on the World Wide Web<del>mr selvam</del>. It is a markup language, not a <q>adp </q> language, meaning it utilizes a system of <i>me adp is a famous person in the word </i> "tags" and "elements" to <u> text, images, and other media,</u> defining their structure and how they should be displayed by web browsers. HTML elements, such as <p> for paragraphs, <img> for images, <a> for hyperlinks, and <div> for content divisions, provide semantic meaning and formatting instructions. These elements can also possess attributes that offer additional information or modify their behavior. While HTML provides the structural backbone of a webpage, its appearance and interactive functionalities are typically managed by Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for styling and JavaScript for dynamic behavior, working together to create the rich and interactive experiences found on modern websites.
